about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  With a foundation in Internal Audit, Information Systems Auditing, and Security, complemented by a Master of Applied Data Science from the University of Michigan, I aim to leverage data analytics to drive informed decision-making within organizations. My goal is to uncover valuable insights from complex datasets, focusing on areas such as stakeholder perceptions, industry dynamics, and emerging trends. I'm committed to upholding strong data governance principles, with a particular emphasis on ethical considerations and responsible use of artificial intelligence.
  
  By integrating advanced analytical techniques into existing processes, I seek to transform raw data into strategic assets that can guide business strategy and risk mitigation efforts. I aim to serve as a bridge between technical analysis and practical application, working collaboratively with diverse teams to ensure that data-driven insights translate into tangible business value. My approach is rooted in continuous learning, adapting to evolving technologies and methodologies to maintain relevance in a rapidly changing landscape.
  
  Throughout my work, I maintain a strong focus on supporting overarching organizational objectives, ensuring that analytical initiatives align with and contribute to the company's strategic goals and long-term success.

          This project marked one of my first endeavors in preparation for my upcoming Master's in Applied Data Science (MADS) at the University of Michigan.

          This prototype served as the foundation for an in-house solution, particularly for internal audit reports. This solution was expanded to import the audit report and analyze all observation paragraphs for readability.

          The tool employs various readability tests and analyses to provide insights and suggestions for enhancing text clarity and comprehension, thereby improving written communication in professional settings.

          **Next step is to implement a local LLM to provide more text improvements recommendations.**

          This use case involves the development of a Data Ethics Checklist for data science projects, created as part of a university ethics course (MADS SIADS593). The checklist is designed to guide data scientists through ethical considerations at various stages of a project, from initial organization to final deployment. It incorporates key ethical principles such as transparency, accountability, fairness, and explainability, drawing from established frameworks and guidelines in the field of data ethics. The checklist is structured around the CRISP-DM model, providing specific, actionable questions at each project phase to ensure ethical practices are maintained throughout the data science workflow.

          This article addresses the frequently asked question "What is an (information security) risk?" from the perspective of an IS Auditor and Information Security Risk Manager. It presents three tailored explanations to accommodate varying levels of audience interest and time constraints. 
          
          The first is a concise formula, the second a comprehensive definition based on industry standards, and the third a detailed exploration using ISO 31000:2009 as a foundation. This multi-tiered approach offers flexibility in explaining information security risk across different professional contexts and audience needs.

          During the process of risk assessment it can be challenging to differentiate between risks, threats and vulnerabilities. This is important, because based on the threats and vulnerabilities – as well as on the impacted assets – the mitigation controls and risk levels can be different.

          In now-a-days processes many of the risk assessment steps are starting with – or including – the term “risk”, although the “real risk” is the results of all those steps and activities. This small, but important difference, will be explained in the following sections.
