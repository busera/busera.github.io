about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  Drawing upon 14 years of experience in Internal Audit, Information Security, and Investigation, coupled with a Master of Applied Data Science from the University of Michigan, I aim to leverage advanced analytics and AI to drive informed decision-making and discussions. My objective is to extract valuable insights from complex datasets, with a focus on uncovering hidden patterns and identifying emerging trends. Throughout this process, I maintain a strong commitment to Data Ethics and Responsible AI practices.

  My approach involves serving as a bridge between technical analysis and practical application, working collaboratively with diverse teams to ensure that data-driven insights translate into tangible business value. I strive to support strategic business decisions through insightful observations and recommendations, always maintaining a strong focus on aligning analytical initiatives with overarching organizational objectives.

  Throughout my career, I remain committed to continuous learning, adapting to evolving technologies and methodologies to maintain effectiveness in navigating the complex intersection of data science, auditing, and [ethical considerations in AI implementation](https://github.com/busera/mads__ds_manifesto/blob/main/manifesto.md).

          Originally developed in my free time to practice Python, Readability Optimizer is a prototype tool designed to help authors improve the readability of their texts.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This project marked one of my first endeavors in preparation for my upcoming Master's in Applied Data Science (MADS) at the University of Michigan.

          This prototype served as the foundation for an in-house solution, particularly for internal audit reports. This solution was expanded to import the audit report and analyze all observation paragraphs for readability.

          The tool employs various readability tests and analyses to provide insights and suggestions for enhancing text clarity and comprehension, thereby improving written communication in professional settings.

          Next step is to implement a local LLM to provide more text improvements recommendations.

          This project was designed to enhance our understanding of the outcomes following traumatic brain injuries, focusing on their determinants and consequences. We used causal inference to investigate the complex relationships between TBI and the subsequent risk of dementia, considering a range of demographic and clinical factors.

        description: |
          The application of data analysis in internal audit has been a topic of increasing interest and discussion in my recent months. While numerous knowledge briefs and guides are available from respected organizations like the IIA and ISACA, these resources often present a more high-level and generic approach. As a professional with a background in data science, Iâve found that many existing resources in this area lack some depth and specificity to better bridge the gap between data analysis theory and its practical application in internal audit.

          This observation has motivated me to create this comprehensive guide. This guide explores the application of data analysis techniques in internal auditing, adapting key concepts from academic research methodologies[5] to the practical world of internal audit focusing on two distinct concept.

          But what happens when these algorithms start to change the very world they are supposed to describe?
          
          This is what we call algorithm ossification, and itâs important phenomenon to understand.

          This use case involved the development of a Data Ethics Checklist for data science projects, created as part of a university ethics course (MADS SIADS593). The checklist is designed to guide data scientists through ethical considerations at various stages of a project, from initial organization to final deployment. It incorporates key ethical principles such as transparency, accountability, fairness, and explainability, drawing from established frameworks and guidelines in the field of data ethics. The checklist is structured around the CRISP-DM model, providing specific, actionable questions at each project phase to ensure ethical practices are maintained throughout the data science workflow.

It presents three tailored explanations to accommodate varying levels of audience interest and time constraints. 
          
          The first is a concise formula, the second a comprehensive definition based on industry standards, and the third a detailed exploration using ISO 31000:2009 as a foundation. This multi-tiered approach offers flexibility in explaining information security risk across different professional contexts and audience needs.

          During the process of risk assessment it can be challenging to differentiate between risks, threats and vulnerabilities. This is important, because based on the threats and vulnerabilities â as well as on the impacted assets â the mitigation controls and risk levels can be different.

          In now-a-days processes many of the risk assessment steps are starting with â or including â the term âriskâ, although the âreal riskâ is the results of all those steps and activities. This small, but important difference, will be explained in the following sections.
