          Originally developed in my free time to practice Python, Readability Optimizer is a prototype tool designed to help authors improve the readability of their texts.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This project marked one of my first endeavors in preparation for my upcoming Master's in Applied Data Science (MADS) at the University of Michigan.

          This prototype served as the foundation for an in-house solution, particularly for internal audit reports. This solution was expanded to import the audit report and analyze all observation paragraphs for readability.

          The tool employs various readability tests and analyses to provide insights and suggestions for enhancing text clarity and comprehension, thereby improving written communication in professional settings.

          **Next step is to implement a local LLM to provide more text improvements recommendations.**

          Key findings indicate that TBIs, especially those involving loss of consciousness, alongside the presence of the APOE ε4 allele and male gender, significantly increase dementia risk, while higher education levels seem to offer some protective effects.

          This project was designed to enhance our understanding of the outcomes following traumatic brain injuries, focusing on their determinants and consequences. We used causal inference to investigate the complex relationships between TBI and the subsequent risk of dementia, considering a range of demographic and clinical factors.

          This project aimed to classify sentences from articles in the "Simple English Wikipedia" to determine whether they require simplification to enhance their accessibility and comprehensibility for audiences with low reading proficiency, including students, children, and non-native English speakers. The project employed supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to extract and create features for sentence classification.

        description: |
          In today’s world, algorithms are a big part of our daily lives. They suggest what we should watch and help decide if we can get a loan. These computer programs make many decisions that affect us all.
          
          But what happens when these algorithms start to change the very world they are supposed to describe?
          
          This is what we call algorithm ossification, and it’s important phenomenon to understand.

          In the evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI) governance, two important concepts can get mixed up: AI System Classification and AI System Risk Assessment. This confusion can lead to problems in managing the related AI risks. This article aims to explain these concepts and how they relate to each other, using insights from major AI governance frameworks.

          This article addresses the frequently asked question "What is an (information security) risk?" from the perspective of an IS Auditor and Information Security Risk Manager. It presents three tailored explanations to accommodate varying levels of audience interest and time constraints. 
          
          The first is a concise formula, the second a comprehensive definition based on industry standards, and the third a detailed exploration using ISO 31000:2009 as a foundation. This multi-tiered approach offers flexibility in explaining information security risk across different professional contexts and audience needs.

          During the process of risk assessment it can be challenging to differentiate between risks, threats and vulnerabilities. This is important, because based on the threats and vulnerabilities – as well as on the impacted assets – the mitigation controls and risk levels can be different.

          In now-a-days processes many of the risk assessment steps are starting with – or including – the term “risk”, although the “real risk” is the results of all those steps and activities. This small, but important difference, will be explained in the following sections.
